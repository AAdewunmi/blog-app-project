## About

Bloggy is a full-featured blogging application providing a clean, secure, and scalable environment for users to create and manage content. It employs industry-standard patterns for authentication (using JWT and Spring Security), persists data efficiently through Spring Data JPA, and integrates Hibernate and MySQL under the hood. The application is fully containerized with Docker, making it deployment-ready for AWS infrastructure.

---

## Features

* **JWT-Based Authentication & Authorization** via Spring Security
* **CRUD Operations** for blog posts and user interactions (to be detailed further)
* **Persistent Storage** with relational database via Spring Data JPA and Hibernate
* **Containerized** deployment using Docker
* **Cloud-Ready** architecture for seamless deployment to AWS
